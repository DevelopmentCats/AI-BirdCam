# Bird Classification Models for Raspberry Pi

## Summary of Available Models

Based on extensive research, here are the most suitable bird classification models for Raspberry Pi that meet the requirements of classifying birds found in the United States, with emphasis on Midwestern American birds.

## Top Recommendation: Google AIY Vision Classifier (Birds V1)

**Recommendation Level: Highest**

- **Download Link**: [Kaggle - Google AIY Vision Classifier Birds V1](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/aiy/tensorFlow1/vision-classifier-birds-v1/1)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow (convertible to TensorFlow Lite)
- **Architecture**: MobileNet V2
- **Advantages**: 
  - Specifically designed for bird classification
  - Optimized for edge devices like Raspberry Pi
  - Created by Google, ensuring quality and reliability
  - Compatible with TensorFlow Lite for efficient deployment
- **Species Coverage**: While the exact species list isn't specified in our research, Google's models typically have comprehensive coverage of North American birds

## Alternative Option: astrocoding Bird Classification Model

**Recommendation Level: High**

- **Repository**: [GitHub - astrocoding/model-ai-bird-classification-tflite](https://github.com/astrocoding/model-ai-bird-classification-tflite)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow Lite
- **Architecture**: MobileNet V2
- **Advantages**:
  - Already in TensorFlow Lite format
  - Specifically designed for bird classification
  - Optimized for mobile and edge devices
- **Limitations**: Specific species coverage needs verification

## General MobileNet V2 Models (Transfer Learning Approach)

**Recommendation Level: Medium**

- **Source**: [TensorFlow Hub - MobileNet V2](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2/mobilenet_v2/1.0_224/feature_vector/5)
- **Approach**: Use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model with a bird dataset
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly customizable for specific bird species
  - Well-documented implementation process
  - Can be optimized specifically for Midwestern birds
- **Limitations**: Requires additional training and dataset preparation

## Bird Species Coverage

For Midwestern United States bird classification, the following common species should be included:

- Northern Cardinal
- Blue Jay
- Mourning Dove
- Black-capped Chickadee
- House Sparrow
- American Robin
- Downy Woodpecker
- White-breasted Nuthatch
- Rose-breasted Grosbeak
- Indigo Bunting
- American Crow
- European Starling
- Various woodpecker species (red-bellied, hairy, downy, pileated)

The Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200) dataset contains photos of 200 bird species, mostly North American, which likely includes many Midwestern species. The NABirds dataset is even more comprehensive with 400 species of birds commonly observed in North America.

## Model Specifications and Requirements

### Hardware Requirements:
- **Recommended**: Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM
- **Minimum**: Raspberry Pi 3B+
- **Storage**: At least 8GB SD card
- **Optional**: Raspberry Pi Camera Module for real-time classification

### Software Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)
- TensorFlow Lite
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV for image processing

### Model Performance:
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% (based on similar implementations)
- **Inference Time**: ~200-500ms per image on Raspberry Pi 4
- **Model Size**: Typically 5-20MB after optimization

## Image Pre-processing Requirements

For optimal performance with MobileNet V2-based models:

1. **Image Resizing**: 
   - Resize input images to 224x224 pixels (standard input size for MobileNet V2)

2. **Pixel Normalization**:
   - Normalize pixel values to range [0,1] or [-1,1] depending on the model
   - Typically: `image = image / 255.0`

3. **Color Format**:
   - Use RGB color format (3 channels)
   - Convert grayscale images to RGB if necessary

4. **Data Augmentation** (for training/fine-tuning):
   - Random rotations
   - Horizontal flips
   - Brightness/contrast adjustments
   - Zoom variations

## Implementation Steps

1. **Download the recommended model**:
   - Google AIY Vision Classifier (Birds V1) from Kaggle: [Download Link](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/aiy/tensorFlow1/vision-classifier-birds-v1/1)
   - Or clone the astrocoding repository: `git clone https://github.com/astrocoding/model-ai-bird-classification-tflite.git`

2. **Set up Raspberry Pi**:
   ```bash
   # Update system
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   
   # Install dependencies
   sudo apt-get install python3-pip
   sudo pip3 install tensorflow
   sudo pip3 install opencv-python
   sudo pip3 install numpy
   
   # For TensorFlow Lite
   sudo pip3 install tflite-runtime
   ```

3. **Convert model to TensorFlow Lite** (if using Google AIY model):
   - Use TensorFlow's converter to optimize the model for Raspberry Pi
   - Example conversion code available in TensorFlow documentation

4. **Deploy and test the model**:
   - Transfer the TensorFlow Lite model to Raspberry Pi
   - Implement inference code
   - Test with sample bird images from the Midwest region

## Conclusion

The Google AIY Vision Classifier (Birds V1) provides the best balance of accuracy, performance, and compatibility for bird classification on Raspberry Pi. It's specifically designed for bird species identification and optimized for edge devices. The model from the astrocoding GitHub repository is a strong alternative, already in TensorFlow Lite format.

For comprehensive coverage of Midwestern American birds, verification of the species included in the model's training dataset is recommended, with potential fine-tuning if necessary.
